>It is a techique to free the memory of unreachable objects 

>in python,it is automatically done by garbage collector(integral part of interpreter),hence the name Automatic Garbage Collection.

>whenever object is going to destroy by gc, __del__() is executed on object and we may override this method to perform any cleanup action on object.

>__del__() is originally defined on object class.

>there are following situations when object becomes eligible for garbage colllection
	>obj=None
	>obj=other object
	>del obj

>python also provides gc module to enable,disable gc.
import gc
gc.enable()
gc.disable()

>Note:gc is a time consuming process,so it is not guaranteed to run gc each time when object becomes eligible.
