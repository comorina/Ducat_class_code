Nested Function:
----------------
>A function is said to be nested if it is defined inside block of other function

def show():		#outer or enclosing function
	def disp():	#nested or local function
	.
	.

why nested function:
--------------------
1>to write function specific reusable stmts
2>data security(nested fun can use data of it's outer function but other function can not access it.)

Function as Argument:
--------------------
>in python we may also pass a function as argument to other function

Function as return value:
------------------------
>in python we may also return a function as value
