The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement:
----------------------------------
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values;
and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name;


The SQL WHERE Clause:
--------------------
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Operator	Description	
=		Equal	
>		Greater than	
<		Less than	
>=		Greater than or equal	
<=		Less than or equal	
!=		Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as <>	
BETWEEN		Between a certain range	
LIKE		Search for a pattern	
IN		To specify multiple possible values for a column


The SQL LIKE Operator:
----------------------
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ - The underscore represents a single character


LIKE Operator				Description
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a%'	Finds any values that have "a" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

The SQL IN Operator:
-------------------
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


The SQL BETWEEN Operator:
-------------------------
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators:
---------------------------------
The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

The SQL ORDER BY Keyword:
-------------------------
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;



The SQL UPDATE Statement:
-----------------------
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...WHERE condition;


The SQL DELETE Statement:
-------------------------
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

How to find missing/NULL values in a column:
--------------------------------------------
select * from table_name where col_name is null;


SQL Constraints:
----------------
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.
Constraints can be column level or table level. 
Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified

SQL NOT NULL Constraint:
------------------------
By default, a column can hold NULL values.
The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.

syntax:
create table table_name(col_name datatype NOT NULL,......)
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY col_name datatype NOT NULL;

SQL UNIQUE Constraint:
----------------------
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.

syntax:
create table table_name(col_name datatype unique,......)
ALTER TABLE table_name add unique(col_name)

SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint:
---------------------------
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

syntyax:
create table table_name(col_name datatype PRIMARY KEY,col_name datatype,......)
or
create table table_name(col_name datatype,col_name datatype,......,PRIMARY KEY(col_name))

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (col_name);
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;

SQL COMPOSITE KEY:
-----------------
A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely
identify each row in the table when the columns are combined uniqueness is guaranteed, 
but when it taken individually it does not guarantee uniqueness.

syntax:
create table table_name(col_name1 datatype,col_name2 datatype,......,PRIMARY KEY(COL1,COL2,..))


SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint:
---------------------------
A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the primary key is called the referenced or parent table. 
The FOREIGN KEY constraint also prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to.

syntax:
create table table_name1(col_name1 datatype,col_name2 datatype,......,PRIMARY KEY(COL))
create table table_name2(col_name1 datatype,col_name2 datatype,......,FOREIGN KEY(COL) 
REFERENCES table_name1(pk_col_table1))

SQL CHECK Constraint:
---------------------
Note:
MySQL 8.0.16 is the first version that supports CHECK constraints.
Read https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-check-constraints.html
If you use MySQL 8.0.15 or earlier, the MySQL Reference Manual says:
The CHECK clause is parsed but ignored by all storage engines.

The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a single column it allows only certain values for this column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.

The following SQL creates a CHECK constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is created.
The CHECK constraint ensures that the age of a person must be 18, or older:

syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);

To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255),
    CONSTRAINT CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes')
);


SQL DEFAULT Constraint:
-----------------------
The DEFAULT constraint is used to provide a default value for a column.
The default value will be added to all new records IF no other value is specified.
The following SQL sets a DEFAULT value for the "City" column when the "Persons" table is created:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Noida'
);

The DEFAULT constraint can also be used to insert system values, by using functions like GETDATE():

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    OrderDate date DEFAULT GETDATE()
);


AUTO INCREMENT Field:
---------------------
Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.
Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

Syntax for MySQL

The following SQL statement defines the "Personid" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (Personid)
);
By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.
To let the AUTO_INCREMENT sequence start with another value, use the following SQL statement:
ALTER TABLE Persons AUTO_INCREMENT=100;


MySQL Functions:
----------------
MySQL has many built-in functions.

Commonly Used String Functions:
-------------------------------
Function		Description
CHAR_LENGTH	Returns the length of a string (in characters)
CONCAT		Adds two or more expressions together
LOWER		Converts a string to lower-case
REVERSE		Reverses a string and returns the result
UPPER		Converts a string to upper-case


Commonly Used Numeric Functions:
--------------------------------
Function		Description
ABS		Returns the absolute value of a number
AVG		Returns the average value of an expression
CEIL		Returns the smallest integer value that is >= to a number
COUNT		Returns the number of records returned by a select query
FLOOR		Returns the largest integer value that is <= to a number
MAX		Returns the maximum value in a set of values
MIN		Returns the minimum value in a set of values
SUM		Calculates the sum of a set of values

Commonly Date Functions:
------------------------
Function		Description
CURDATE		Returns the current date
CURTIME		Returns the current time
NOW		Returns the current date and time


SQL Aliases:
------------
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of the query.

SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;

Create Table Using Another Table:
---------------------------------
A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE.
The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected.
If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.

Syntax:
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...
    FROM existing_table_name
    WHERE ....;


SQL Views:
----------
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. 
The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


SQL JOIN:
--------
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

INNER JOIN: 
----------
Returns records that have matching values in both tables

syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: 
------------------
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). 
The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: 
-------------------
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). 
The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


FULL (OUTER) JOIN:
------------------
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

Note:
MySQL does not support full outer join you can implement it by taking union of left and right joins.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name 
UNION
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
