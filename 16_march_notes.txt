return stmt in function:
------------------------
	>it is used to return the result of function to the
calling statement.

	>conceptually it shud be the last stmt in fun.

syntax:
	def fun_name():
	..
	..
	return val/var/exp

	>a function may return multiple values in the form of list/tuple/set/dict...

	>function gets terminated after executing first return stmt.

	>if we do not write return stmt explicitly,python automatically returns None.

	>return type of function is dynamically decided by
language itself based on return value.

Local & Global variables:
-------------------------
	>A variable is said to be local if it is initialized inside function block.

	>local var can not be used outside it's function block(scope).

	>A variable is said to be global if it initialized outside function.

	>bydefault,global var can be used by function in read mode and if fun try to modify it's value ,it is considered as new local var of this fun.

	>if you want to modify global var inside fun,declare it using global keyword then modify.

exp:
	x=10
	def fun()
	   x=20  #new local


	x=10
	def fun()
	  global x
	  x=20  #modify global x
