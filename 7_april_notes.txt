syntax to create class:
-----------------------
class classname:
  stmts

syntax to create object:
------------------------
	classname()
	or
	refvar=classname()

Note:There are some lib classes that can be instantiated using 
literals/symbols,like int,float,list,dict,tuple,....

	exp:
	int is a lib class and it can be instantiated like
	i=int()   standard way
	i=10      literal way

Object Initialization:
----------------------
>it is a process of adding data members to object just 
after creating it.

>constructor is used to initialize object.

>in python,constructor is a special method represented by
__init__() and it is executed by python itself whenever an object 
is created of that class.
