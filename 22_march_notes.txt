Errors in Python:
-----------------
	>Syntax/Parsing Errors
		>due to invalid syntax
	>Exceptions
		>due to unsupported operation
		>due to lack of resources(var/memory/connection/file/module/....)

>An exception is an unwanted event/action/situation that occurs during execution of stmts.

>occurence of such event terminates the program abnormally.

Commonly Used Exceptions:
-------------------------
>IndexError:	use of invalid index
>ValueError:	invalid type conversion
>TypeError:	invalid usage of value in an operation
>keyError:	use of invalid key in dict
>NameError:	variable/function not found
etc.

Exception Handling:
-------------------
>it is technique to avoid abnormal program termination by
executing alternate stmts.

>python provides following keywords to implement E.H.
	>try
	>except
	>finally
	>raise
	>assert

try:
----
	>it contains those set of stmts(logically related) whose execution may generate exception.

	>after try block we must use either except or finally block.

Possible combination of try/except:
-----------------------------------
	try:
	..
        except SpecificException:
	..

	try:
	..
	except(Exp1,Exp2,...):
	..

	try:
	..
	except Exception:	#parent exception
	..

	try:
	..
	except:			#default
	..
Note:
>Exception(parent) can not handle KeyboardInterrupt & StopIteration but default except can handle any exception.

>default except must be last handler of try.

>those stmts of try are never executed that occur after execption.
