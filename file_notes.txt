File Handling:
-------------
Step 1:
	open a file

step 2:
	read or write

step 3:
	close the file

open():
------
	>it is used to open a file in a specific mode.
	
	var=open('file path','mode')

Commonly used modes:
--------------------
r	->read in text
w	->write in text
rb	->read in binray
wb	->write in binary
a	->append in text
r+	->read and write
w+	->write and read
a+	->append and read
  

File Variables:
--------------
file.mode	#returns mode of file
file.closed	#returns True if file is closed else False

File Methods:
-------------
file.tell()	#returns current position of internal pointer
		initially,pos of file pointer is just before first char i.e. 0

file.seek():	#sets the current pos of pointer in absolute manner(bydefault)

file.read():	#read all chars as string from next char of pointer pos and also moves pointer pos by number of read chars.

file.read(5):	#read 5 chars as string from next char of pointer pos.

file.readline():#read a line as string from next char of pointer pos.

file.readlines():#read all lines as strings and return them as list.

file.write():	#write() a string to file buffer

file.flush():	#flush the buffer(write data to actual file)

file.close():	#close() the file by flushing the buffer(if write mode)

with statement:
--------------
with resource as alias:
	stmts

here resource may be:
	>opening a file
	>database connection
	>socket connection
	etc.

advantage:
----------
>we need not to close the resource explicitly
>resource gets closed automatically when we complete with block
